# OAIS 

Open Archival Information System 

It was created for space data, and for some reason archivists just love it. 

---
# SIP, AIP, DIP 

Submission Information Package (SIP): which is the information sent from the producer to the archive
Archival Information Package (AIP): which is the information stored by the archive
Dissemination Information Package (DIP): which is the information sent to a user when requested

---

There are six functional entities in an OAIS:

- Ingest 
- Storage 
- Data management 
- Administration
- Preservation planning 
- Access 

---
# Ingest 

Ingest function: receives information from producers and packages it for storage. It accepts a SIP, verifies it, creates an AIP from the SIP, and transfers the newly created AIP to archival storage

---
# Archival storage

Archival Storage function: stores, maintains, and retrieves AIPs. It accepts AIPs submitted from the Ingest function, assigns them to long term storage, migrates AIPs as needed, checks for errors, and provides requested AIPs to the Access function

---
# Data management 

Data Management function: coordinates the Descriptive Information of the AIPs and the system information that supports the archive. It maintains the database that contains the archive's information by executing query requests and generating results; generates reports in support of other functions; and updates the database.

---
# Administration 

Administration function: manages the daily operations of the archive. This function attains submission agreements from information producers, performs system engineering, audits SIPs to ensure compliance with submission agreements, develops policies and standards. It handles customer service and acts as 
the interface between Management and the Designated Community in the OAIS environment.

---
# Preservation planning

Preservation Planning function: supports all tasks to keep the archive material accessible and understandable over long terms even if the original computing system becomes obsolete, e.g. development of detailed preservation/migration plans, technology watch, evaluation and risk analysis of content and recommendation of update and migration.

---
# Access 

Access function: This function includes the user interface that allows users to retrieve information from the archive. It generates a DIP from the relevant AIP and delivers it to the customer who has requested the information.[3]
