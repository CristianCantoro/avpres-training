# What is MediaConch?

*MediaConch is an open source software project consisting of a toolset that aims to further develop the standardization and validation of preservation-level audiovisual files used within various memory institutions and communities. The software consists of an implementation checker, policy checker, reporter and fixer that will work together to offer its users an advanced level of ability to validate, assess and find solutions to repair the digital files within their collections. Accessible via either the command line, a graphical user interface (GUI), or web-based shell, the MediaConch project will serve to provide detailed individual and batch-level conformance checking analysis using its adaptable, flexible and interoperable software application interface. With a project focus dedicated to furthering the longevity of Matroska, Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) and FF Video Codec 1 (FFV1) as recommended digital preservation audiovisual formats, MediaConch will anticipate and contribute to the further development of the standardization of these formats. The MediaConch open source project was created and is currently under development by MediaArea, notable for the creation of MediaInfo, an open source media checker software application.*

# OAIS-compliant

MediaConch was developed with OAIS in mind. It is suitable for use in validation during:

- "pre-Ingest"
- Submission Information Package (SIP) creation
- Archival Information Package (AIP) creation
- Dissemination Information Package (DIP) creation
- regular checkups 

---
# Validates against specifications

MediaConch checks out each video file and makes sure that it conforms to the file format's specification. It supports Matroska, FFV1, LPCM, PDF, and TIFF but will be expanded to include more formats in the future.

---
# Works for most files 

MediaConch was made for Matroska, FFV1, and LPCM but since it is based on MediaInfo, it can handle most any type of file.  

---
# Custom profiles 

MediaConch supports the ability to create custom profiles to fit your institutional needs. Custom profiles are easily made using the GUI version of MediaConch, and can be exported, imported, or shared publicly on the [MediaConchOnline Public Policies page](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConchOnline/publicPolicies).  

Policies can be made for any type of file that MediaInfo supports.  

---
# Open source 

MediaConch is open source, so you can optimize it for your needs, if you want to.

---
# Support available

MediaArea watches the Github Issues trackers closely and is quick to respond to issues if they arise. If an issue is bigger, MediaArea can be hired to build out a new feature or a custom installation.
