## Installation 

Option 1 (using direct download)
Go to https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch/
Click on Download button
Click on the icon for the operating system you use (likely Windows or Mac)
Click on the Universal installer GUI (for Windows) or GUI v16.09 (Mac)
Save to your Downloads folder and double click to open and install
If you are using a computer that belongs to your employer you may need to get administrative rights from your IT department in order to install. If you don’t have administrative rights you can still use MediaConch: on the download page, peek the version “without installer”.

Graphical interface (Mac):
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install mediaconch-app

Command line (Mac/Linux):
brew install mediaconch
