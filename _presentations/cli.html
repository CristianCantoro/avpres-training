# Command Line Interface

# What is Command Line Interface?

A **terminal window** is a text-only window in a **graphical user interface** (GUI) that emulates a console.

A GUI is a type of human-computer interface (i.e., a system for people to interact with a computer) that uses windows, icons, pull-down menus and a pointer and that can be manipulated by a mouse (and usually to some extent by a keyboard as well). 

A **command** is an instruction telling a computer to do something, such as launch a program.

A **command line interface** (CLI) is an all-text display mode that has a command interpreter running in it and that shows commands, including their arguments, and other data as they are typed in at the keyboard as well as the results of most such commands. 

A command interpreter, also referred to as a **shell**, is a program whose primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window and then execute (i.e., run) them.
