# What is FFplay?

FFplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a testbed for the various FFmpeg APIs. But can be useful for archivists, too.
---

# Why is FFplay important?

- plays all files that ffmpeg can play (which is a lot!)
- can apply filters to visualize problems with files 
- fun things

# Example 1

Show all pixels outside of acceptable broadcast range.  

## `ffplay -f lavfi "movie='input.mp4', signalstats=out=brng:color=cyan[out]"`

---

# Example 1, explained

**`ffplay`** starts the command  
**`-f lavfi`** tells ffplay to use the Libavfilter input virtual device  
**`"`** quotation mark to start the lavfi filtergraph  
**`movie='input.mp4'`** declares video file source to apply filter  
**`,`** comma signifies closing of video source assertion and ready for filter assertion  
**`signalstats=out=brng:`**: tells ffplay to use the signalstats command, output the data, use the brng filter  
**`:`** indicates there‚Äôs another parameter coming  
**`color=cyan[out]`** sets the color of out-of-range pixels to cyan  
**`"`** quotation mark to end the lavfi filtergraph
